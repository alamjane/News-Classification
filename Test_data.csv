with interest rate tenders following the introduction of a new system to speed up the tender process at the start of april they said ? ? head of the monetary policy section at the diw economic research institute in west berlin said the bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts i don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little it would stop a wave of currency speculation he said but a sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the bundesbank to take some action he said ? said the bundesbank was concerned that a cut in interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth some bundesbank officials have argued recently that the monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather than credit growth and therefore a more appropriate response to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates to make the mark and mark investments less attractive ? said the bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors would switch funds ? in liquid short term accounts which have ? central bank money stock into securities which would take them out of the bundesbank's key monetary measure a cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next move would be upwards they would therefore hold off buying bonds leaving central bank money stock ? there are so far no signs that german investors are switching funds into long term securities as the bundesbank hopes they will berliner ? und ? bank economist hermann ? said but phillips and ? reid said prospects of lower rates and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into german bonds which would in turn attract domestic investors werner rein chief economist at union bank of switzerland in zurich said he thought it likely that interest rates would continue to ? lower in many european countries the scope for lower rates is probably greatest in britain but more limited in west germany where we could see some consolidation he said switzerland could be forced to match any cut in german rates to prevent the franc rising further against the mark he said currency dealers in london said another half point cut in u k bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the pound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising reuter 3
